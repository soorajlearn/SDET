1) Given an array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

Input: [-8,-3,4,3,10]
Output: [9,9,16,64,100]


2) Given an array of integers, a lucky integer is an integer which has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return a lucky integer in the array. If there are multiple lucky integers return the largest of them. If there is no lucky integer return -1.

Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: 1, 2 and 4 are all lucky numbers, but 4 is the largest

3) Given an array, return true if and only if the given array A is monotonic.

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5]
Output: true

Input: [1,2,5,3,4,4,4,4,5]
Output: false

Input: [5,4,4,2,1]
Output: true

4) Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. 
Note: It is kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 3
Output: 5

5) Find all the missing numbers in the given array

Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]

6) Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Interview Question from Amazon

7) Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.

Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.

8) Find the peak index in a mountain array

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: arr = [0,4,2,0]
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
Output: 1
