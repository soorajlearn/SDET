1) Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: True
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
Example 2:

Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: False

2) Rotate an image

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

3) Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

Here, use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 4:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]

4) Once upon time there was a cute princess called Farida living in a castle 
with her father, mother and uncle. On the way to the castle there lived many monsters. 
Each one of them had some gold coins. Although they are monsters they will not hurt.
 Instead they will give you the gold coins, but if and only if you didn't take any 
 coins from the monster directly before the current one. 
 To marry princess Farida you have to pass all the monsters 
 and collect as many coins as possible. 
 Given the number of gold coins each monster has, calculate the maximum 
 number of coins you can collect on your way to the castle.

5) Given a matrix, print it in Reverse Wave Form.

Input :  1  2  3  4
         5  6  7  8
         9  10 11 12
         13 14 15 16
		 
Output : 4 8 12 16 15 11 7 3 2 6 10 14 13 9 5 1

6) Given a string, how many palindromic substrings in this string.

Example 1:

Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

Example 2:

Input: "aabc"
Output: 4
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c", "aa".

7) Given two sorted arrays A1, A2. Write a code to find median of the arrays

Example 1:

Input:

A1 = [1,3]
A2 = [2]

Output: 2

Example 2:

Input:

A1 = [1,2]
A2 = [3,4]

Output: 2.5


8) Given 2 Strings with length n and (n+1) respectively. The second String contains all the characters of first but with an extra char. Write the code to find the extra char

Example 1:

Input:

A1 = "Test"
A2 = "Test$"

Output: '$'

Example 2:

Input:

A1 = "Hello"
A2 = "lloreH"

Output: 'r'

9) Write a program that tells all the words containing same letters(anagram)
Input  : "Stale are there in tesla and you can steal the pears"
Output : [Stale, tesla, steal]
